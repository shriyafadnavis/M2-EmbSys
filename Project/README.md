# # # Abstract


solar tracker, a system that positions an object at an angle relative to the Sun. The most-common applications for solar trackers are positioning photovoltaic (PV) panels (solar panels) so that they remain perpendicular to the Sun's rays and positioning space telescopes so that they can determine the Sun's direction.
