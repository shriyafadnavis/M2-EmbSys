# Abstract

*Solar Tracker using Arduino uno*

solar tracker, a system that positions an object at an angle relative to the Sun. The most-common applications for solar trackers are positioning photovoltaic (PV) panels (solar panels) so that they remain perpendicular to the Sun's rays and positioning space telescopes so that they can determine the Sun's direction.

In modern solar tracking systems, the solar panels are fixed on a structure that moves according to the position of the sun.

In this project the focus is on the implementation of solar tracker using ldr sensors
